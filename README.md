# FS1000 Final Project: Calisthetics

## About The App

Calisthetics is a fitness tracking app at it's core. Users have access to a multitude of features such as: Tracking, creating, and editing custom workout routines, tracking water intake, searching through a large library of exercises, looking at past workout statistics, adding daily/weekly schedules, and more. The app mainly focuses on calisthenics, which is a strength training method using your own bodyweight as resistance in comparison to weightlifting or bodybuilding, using free weights such as barbells, dumbbells, and kettlebells as well as machines.
